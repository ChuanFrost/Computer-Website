# Computer-Website

This project has two sides. Customer and Admin side. For some part, we will separate the two modules.

## Controller

Located in app > HTTP > Controller

You will see Admin folder and Customer folder.


To create within the folder, you can use "php artisan make:controller Admin/testController". Folder then followed by controller with '/'.

## Model

Located in app > Providers

## Views

Located in resources > views

You will see Admin folder and Customer folder.

*For some tutorial on blade layout, routing to controller method and ajax request response example. You may refer to Laravel Tutorial.*

Apologies, had to separate Laravel Tutorial. I might use it in the future.
